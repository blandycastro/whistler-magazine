            <h2>Whistler made a name for itself as an extreme sporting destination, but there’s a mellow side of the mountain community to explore</h2>

            <p class="story-lead">On the surface, Whistler appears to be a place that operates at one speed: breakneck.</p>
            <p>In this town, we zoom down mountains on skis, bikes and boards; scramble up rock faces and scurry around the woods, backpack fastened on tight.</p>
            <p>But there’s another side to Whistler, too. It’s lesser known, a little softer and the pace is cranked down to a crawl. For visitors and locals alike, the town boasts a hidden treasure trove of activities to kick back and relax. Looking for world-class spas where you can enjoy a massage, eucalyptus steam or hot tub? We’ve got those. Or maybe you’re interested in sunning yourself lakeside then jumping into clean, clear water for a swim? You can do that here, too. Also up for offer: endless yoga studios — even a yoga-centred festival in the summer — mellow bike trails for taking in nature at a leisurely pace and summer farmers’ markets with fresh food, entertainment and crafts to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Speed might always reign supreme in Whistler, but we’re here to show you that taking the scenic route comes with its own rewards.</p>

            <h3>Take the tracks less travelled</h3>
            <p>If you’re going to enjoy a relaxing vacation in Whistler, why not start things off right?</p>
            <p>The Rocky Mountaineer, a train that takes the coastal route just off the Sea to Sky Highway from April until October, snakes its way from North Vancouver to Whistler over a luxurious four hours.</p>
            <p>“The amazing thing is the scenery,” said Shannon Kidd, communications manager with the company. “The way the track goes, it winds around some amazing views.”</p>
            <p>On top of lunch and snacks, another perk of the journey is an outdoor car that allows travellers to enjoy fresh air and snap pictures during their adventure. “The train is below the highway, so you get a really different perspective going up the inlet,” Kidd said.</p>
            <p>“We have a heritage observation car as well, so people can go outside and take photos. The train goes at a pace where that’s very doable.”</p>
            <p>A range of entertainers is also on board to educate riders about the land on which they’re travelling.
            <p>“We have on-board hosts on all of our train journeys,” Kidd said. “Part of what they do is tell stories about history and the sites. They’re there to entertain guests, but they have a lot of great stories to tell and history to share.”</p>

                <h2>A spot of <em>tee</em></h2>
                <h3>What better way to enjoy an easygoing afternoon than by strolling the fairways of one of the wonderful golf courses in the Whistler area?</h3>
                <p>The Sea to Sky corridor is truly one of Canada’s most impressive golfing destinations, with three impeccable courses sitting right here in the resort.</p>
                <p>The Whistler Golf Club, located right next to the Village, is the town’s oldest track. This Arnold Palmer design opened in 1983, but has especially delighted players recently after the installation of brand-new, bent-grass greens.</p>
                <p>The Fairmont Chateau Whistler Golf Course is a true test of mountain golf built right into the foot of Blackcomb Mountain. The unique setting and breathtaking scenery will make your round unforgettable.</p>
                <p>Nicklaus North, designed by Jack Nicklaus himself, is a short drive north of the Village. It boasts B.C.’s trickiest collection of par-3s, situated on picturesque Green Lake.</p>
                <p>Up in Pemberton, Big Sky Golf and Country club is one of the best-manicured courses in the province, set against the incredible backdrop of Mount Currie. The Meadows at Pemberton is right next door, offering the Sea to Sky’s most affordable green fees.</p>
                <p>Also don’t miss Furry Creek Golf and Country Club, a challenging and unconventional layout just south of Squamish, right on the shore of Howe Sound.</p>

                <figcaption>You can spend all day relaxing at Scandinave Spa, going from hot baths to the sauna, from a massage to a peaceful spot in the gardens. Photo courtesy Scandinave Spa</figcaption>

            <h3>Unwind with Whistler's spas</h3>
            <p>When Scandinave Spa opened its doors in Whistler four years ago, people didn’t know what to make of it.</p>
            <p>Nestled into the woods just outside Whistler Village, the tranquil venue offers visitors traditional Scandinavian baths. That experience involves soaking in hot baths, refreshing in cold pools and relaxing in between. The benefits are said to include everything from increased circulation to rejuvenation. The spa also offers a eucalyptus steam room, a wood-fired sauna and registered massage therapists on site.</p>
            <p>Once locals tried it, they were sold. “There are certain aspects of the spa that people come for,” said general manager Doug DeYagher.</p>
            <p>“Most people don’t know what they’re coming for until they get there. It’s always beyond their expectations.</p>
            <p>“Say you’re in hydrotherapy for an hour, then you go in for a Swedish or deep-tissue massage for an hour — your body is just totally relaxed.”</p>
            <p>Another perk: Visitors must be completely silent the whole time they’re in the spa’s baths. That means no visiting, no phone calls and no noise to distract from focusing on relaxing.</p>
            <p>“You’re not used to that,” DeYagher said. “Your body’s not used to it, your mind is not used to it. That time goes by so fast because you’re not aware. When you’re in that Zen state, you think five minutes have gone by and you look at your clock and half-an-hour has passed.”</p>
            <p>Other top-name spas in the area include the Hidden Lodge Day Spa in the Upper Village, The Spa at picturesque Nita Lake Lodge and the Whistler Day Spa.</p>
            <p>Many high-end hotels in town also boast fine spas as well, including the Avello Spa at the Westin, Vida Spa at the Fairmont and The Spa at the Four Seasons.</p>
            
            <h3>Take a moment at the market</h3>
            <p>The Farmers’ Market — which runs every Sunday from June 15 until Oct. 12 in the Upper Village — came from humble beginnings.</p>
            <p>Back in 1994, it wasn’t much more than produce from one farmer and a few crafters selling their goods. But in the last two decades it’s grown substantially, with 80 vendors offering their fruit, produce and artisan goods to a crowd of visitors and locals.</p>
            <p>You’ll want to take your time wandering in between each vendor’s tent to check out the unique products and items to take back to your kitchen, souvenirs of your Whistler visit or hand-crafted jewelry and home decor. It’s the perfect way to spend a relaxing Sunday.</p>
            <p>Every installment features local music entertainment to liven up the picturesque location at the base of Blackcomb Mountain. The market also runs Wednesday afternoons in July and August.</p>

            <h3>Feel great by floating</h3>
            <p>West Coast Float might sound like an otherworldly experience to the uninitiated.</p>
            <p>Floaters get into pods filled with water and Epsom salts, set to the same temperature as their skin, close the door, and simply float for 90 minutes.</p>
            <p>“Floating has been around for a long, long time,” said Bob Van Engelsdorp, who founded Whistler’s first float location in December 2013. “It started off in the States, but it died down in the ’70s. Since then, it’s exploded in Europe. There are over 400 centres there. It’s making a comeback.”</p>
            <p>After a particularly memorable float in Portland, followed by another positive experience in Vancouver, Van Engelsdorp was certain the trend would take off in Whistler.</p>
            <p>The motivation behind floating is sensory deprivation — that means no touch, sight or sound — which lets customers experience a blissful hour-and-a-half of relaxation. (Floaters are in complete control of lights and can exit at any time, Van Engelsdorp noted.)</p>
            <p>“It’s like a highway to meditation for people,” he said. “A lot of the outside sensations are taken away already and people are very happy with that.”</p>
            <p>In addition to the pods, the company also offers two different open pools (which fit two people) for the claustrophobic, or those who want to try floating with a partner.</p>

            <h3>Head out on a hike</h3>
            <p>The Peak 2 Peak Gondola might be best known for transporting skiers and snowboarders between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains, but it also serves as a breathtaking shuttle to some of the best hikes the resort has to offer.</p>
            <p>Boasting more than 50 kilometres of hiking, running and interpretive alpine trails, Whistler Blackcomb has paths for leisurely strolls, as well as more arduous treks for those who want a challenge. Another perk of picking this route: When you need a break, head back to a mountaintop restaurant for ice cream, lunch or cold drinks.</p>
            <p>Summer hiking starts in June and carries on until early October, with each season offering different and equally beautiful views.

            <h3>Centre yourself with yoga</h3>
            <p>Whistler has become a hub for great yoga studios over the last several years, as more and more teachers with experience gleaned from practicing all over the world call the town home.
“We have some of the best instructors in the world,” said Colleen Felgate, owner and primary teacher at Yama Yoga. “The calibre in Whistler is probably the equivalent of most major cities. You come into this tiny town and you have people who have taught all over the world.”</p>
            <p>For the past two years, Wanderlust, a major yoga festival, picked up on Whistler’s Zen vibes and made it a stop on the festival circuit. This year, it will bring well-known yoga teachers, music and lecturers to town from July 31 to Aug. 4. With so many different activities ongoing from dawn to after midnight, it’s a gathering you can tailor to your interests and take at your own pace.</p>
            <p>“The community embraces it,” Felgate said. “There are so many people involved in yoga here. It’s massive.”</p>
            <p>While her studio — tucked away just off the Village Stroll — attracts locals, it also caters to visitors with a variety of drop-in options and 10 different yoga styles.
“I would say my most popular class is après yoga, all year round,” Felgate said. “It’s ‘après’ whatever your day is, whether you’re a hiker, biker or skier. It has the most variety in it with lots of options for those who want to have a mellow class, or those looking for a stronger class with flow to it. That’s appealing to most people.”</p>
            <p>Other studios to check out include Yogacara Studios, YYoga, Jivamukti Yoga, Pacific Elements Yoga School and White Gold Yoga, just to name a few.</p>
